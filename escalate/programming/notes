I'm going to give you a number in hexadecimal
You're going to send one back in decimal. Cool?
Cool. Here we go: 5f45

# need to convert with python

Boom! That's it!
Okay, okay. Another!
This time this one is decimal. 35189
What's it in binary?
1000100101110101
Sweet! Okay, okay, okay...
ONE MORE!
Two numbers. Both hexadecimal: 7996d0bb 359e5cc9
Give me the product of the two numbers as an                             unsigned 32-bit int.
Send it back as hexadecimal.
*yawn*
