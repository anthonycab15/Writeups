# All-Army CyberStakes 4: 24 April - 03 May 2020

I have included writeups only from the less trivial challenges that I solved during the competition.  Other writeups have been completed by [welchbj](https://github.com/welchbj/ctf/tree/master/writeups/2020/CyberStakes), [archang31](https://github.com/archang31/aacs4-writeups), [flakjacket95](https://github.com/flakjacket95/cyberstakes_2020), [steveirwincyber](https://github.com/steveirwincyber/CyberStakes2020/tree/master), and [nic-hartley](https://nic-hartley.github.io/acictf-writeups/
